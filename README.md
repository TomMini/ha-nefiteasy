## FAQ
#### HA cannot connect to Bosch cloud 

If you experience errors during the boot of HA regarding the connection to the Bosch cloud ie ```Timeout while connecting to Bosch cloud. Retrying in the background```, you may want to change the OpenSSL configuration.
The OpenSSL defaults for Buster are causing the problem, probably because Nefit/Bosch is using either an outdated TLS version or an outdated cipher.

Edit ```/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf``` and change the system wide defaults back to their previous values(pre-Buster):
```
MinProtocol = None
CipherString = DEFAULT
```
